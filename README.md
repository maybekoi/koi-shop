# PORTS

## Angry Neighbor - A simple port of angry neighbor.

* Notes For Angry Neighbor:

```
Touch Controls only. (Sorry not sorry!)
```

## Baldi's Basics Hide and Seek Remastered V1 - A port of some mod that got taken down from gamebanana

* Notes for BBHASRv1:

```
THIS IS AN EARLY BUILD, CRASHES MAY HAPPEN, MAIN ONE IS THAT THE GAME RANDOMLY CRASHES WHEN YOU GET AN ANSWER WRONG, IT CAN MAINLY HAPPEN WHEN GOING FOR THE FIRST 2 NOTEBOOKS.
